## Rule Title Here

**Impact: MEDIUM (optional impact description)**

Brief explanation of the rule and why it matters for GasGuru architecture. This should be clear and concise, explaining the architectural implications.

**Incorrect (description of what's wrong):**

```kotlin
// Bad code example here
// This violates GasGuru architecture patterns
class BadExample {
    // ...
}
```

**Correct (description of what's right):**

```kotlin
// Good code example here
// This follows GasGuru architecture patterns
class GoodExample {
    // ...
}
```
